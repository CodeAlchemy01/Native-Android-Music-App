**Project Overview**  
An Android music application is developed as part of the GDSC Android Development Bootcamp 2024. The app fetches data from the Deezer API to stream music and offers an intuitive UI to search and play music tracks. It leverages Retrofit, Gson, and Picasso to handle API data, display images, and manage audio playback.

**Key Features**  
- Search and stream music using the Deezer API.  
- Display music track information like album art, title, and artist.  
- Play and pause music tracks directly within the app.  
- Dynamic list of tracks fetched from the API with RecyclerView support.

**My Contributions**  
As an Android native (Kotlin) developer, I was responsible for integrating the Deezer API to fetch music data, handling the Retrofit API calls and response parsing. I also developed the RecyclerView adapter to display a dynamic list of tracks with album art, titles, and artists. Additionally, I designed the UI to allow users to search and play music, and implemented audio playback functionality using `MediaPlayer` for play/pause controls. My contributions also involved ensuring smooth interaction between UI elements, handling asynchronous tasks, and optimizing the overall user experience within the app.
